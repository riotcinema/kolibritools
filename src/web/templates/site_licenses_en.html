	        <p>A guide with everything you can do with the material of “The Cosmonaut”.</p>
	        <h3><strong>1. The film</strong></h3>
	        <p>The film is published under Attribution – NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 (by-nc-nd) PLUS</p>
	        <p>What you can do: COPY and EXHIBIT it.</p>
	        <p>What you have to do: Name us as authors of the original piece (indicating “The Cosmonaut” as the original source and the URL “cosmonautexperience.com”). What you cannot do: Make a profit (without consulting us beforehand) and/or create derived pieces using the material.</p>
	        <p>BUT, the inclusion of PLUS at the end of the license allows for some additional uses.</p>
	        <p>PLUS</p>
	        <p>- Profit:</p>
	        <p>The license we have used allows for non-commercial uses of all kinds (you can organize screenings to show the film, copy it in any format, share it on social networks…) and you can also do a PROFIT USE so long as you check with us first.</p> 
	        <p>- Derived piece (remix):</p>
	        <p>The only reason why the films license does not allow for derived pieces is because the film contains certain songs and archive footage with copyright for which we only have the distribution rights but not those for modification and we have to respect someone else’s copyright. The rest of the material (for which we do have the rights) have a BySaNc license that allows remixes.</p> 
	        <p>Thus, you can modify and create new pieces with all the material except the ones we detail below:</p>
	        <br/>
	
	        <p><strong>MUSIC</strong> (even though you can’t use these songs YOU CAN use the images that accompany them so long as you show them with different music):</p>

	        <p>Each webisode is published under different licenses depending on their content. Every time there is someone else’s piece the webisode has a BY NC ND Plus license because, except the archive footage images which are specified and the songs from other authors, the rest of the images and sounds do allow for their modification but you have to check each case separately.</p> 
	        <p>What you can do: COPY and EXHIBIT it.</p>
	        <p>What you have to do: Name us as authors of the original piece (indicating “The Cosmonaut” as the original source and the URL “cosmonautexperience.com”). What you cannot do: Make a profit (without consulting us beforehand) and/or create derived pieces using the material.</p>
	        <p>BUT, the inclusion of PLUS at the end of the license allows for some additional uses.</p>

	        <h3>3. Eastern Eggs</h3>
	        <p>We call Eastern Eggs to the fiction material published under the heading “Behind the camers” in the website, and under the heading “Eastern Eggs” of the USB.</p>
	        <p>Each webisode is published under a different license depending on its content. So long as there are no pieces from someone else in the webisode it will have an BY NC SA license. In the other cases, it will have an BY NC ND Plus license because, except for the archive footage images which are specified and the songs from someone else other than us, the rest of the images and sounds do allow for modification but you must check each case separately.</p> 
	        <p>What you can do: COPY and EXHIBIT it</p>
	        <p>What you must do: Name us as authors of the original piece (indicating “The Cosmonaut” as the origin and the URL “cosmonautexperience.com”)</p>
	        <p>What you cannot do: Make a profit (without checking with us first) and/or create derived pieces using the material.</p>
	        <p>BUT, the inclusion of PLUS at the end of the license allows for some additional uses which we do allow.</p>
	        <p>Here is a guide of the licenses for each episode (the time codes correspond to the webisodes published on the website http://cosmonautexperience.com):</p>
